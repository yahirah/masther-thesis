\section*{What has been done this week}
In last two weeks:
\begin{itemize}
\item I've had a conversation with the occupational therapist, whom explained to me what a coordination game should look like, what the game properties should be and told me about examples of game she use in such cases with her patients. 
\item I prepared a list of items that I want to test
\item I made extensive research to gather "theoretical" properties of all the devices
\item I started testing of the devices in the area of "detailed gesture recognition"
\end{itemize}

\section*{Project status according to the study plan}
%all nice and well
I should have been done with testing by the end this week, which I'm not, but because I already started the implementation part, it is acceptable delay. 

\section*{Plan for the next weeks}
In next week I want to finish the testing and decide on application test days and the devices to be used. 
In next weeks I want to fully commit to development of the game.
