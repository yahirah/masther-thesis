\section*{What has been done this week}
I wrote summary of a previously read literature and also found few new articles, included in the summary. Summary can be found in \href{https://github.com/yahirah/masther-thesis/blob/master/thesis/Thesis.pdf}{thesis} under section 2.2
I contacted the therapist and now I'm waiting for the answer.
I installed the Unity3D \cite{unity} game development platform and I try follow some tutorials to know how it works.
I prepared the list of things I want to take under consideration while testing devices and it is available in thesis under chapter 3. 


\section*{Project status according to the study plan}
%all nice and well
Although I haven't start testing, I decided to spend some time on starting some work from next weeks, so right now I am still working with no significant delay.

\section*{Plan for the next weeks}
I want to incorporate answers from therapist in my analysis.
I need to get the devices to start extensive testing.
I want to get more familiar with Unity3D framework.
