\section*{What has been done this week}
I prepared functioning demo of the game, which allows to shoot one type of monster with 5 different type of gestures. It is controlled by 2 armbands and has basic control sequence, that allows to "check" the game, then play it until shooting satisfying amount of objects, and then repeat the game if desired.

\section*{Project status according to the study plan}
There is no delay in the plan.

\section*{Plan for the next weeks}
Check the game with some children and show it to the therapist to evaluate its potential usefulness in rehabilitation. Implement having different monster reacting to different lasers.
