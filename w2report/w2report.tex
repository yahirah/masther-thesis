\section*{What has been done this week}
A raw version of CP analysis has been written and can be found as chapter 2, section 2.1. in \href{https://github.com/yahirah/masther-thesis/blob/master/thesis/Thesis.pdf}{this file in repository}. I found new software for eye movement control called \href{https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki}{OptiKey} that I need to test in later phases. 

\subsection*{Project status according to the study plan}
There is a few days of overlap with CP topic and current solution theme, but on the other hand, I closed the topic of analysis with creating a detailed description that can be directly used in the thesis. I also already started working on current week topic before, so I've got some materials prepared. 

\section*{Plan for the next weeks}
Focus on researching "current solution" topic, make nice articles description and hopefully (in two weeks) description of this analysis for thesis.
