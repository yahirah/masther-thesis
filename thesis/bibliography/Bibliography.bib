@article{vr_cp,
abstract = {Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have difficulty controlling and coordinating voluntary muscle, which results in poor selective control of muscle activity. Children with spastic CP completed ankle selective motor control exercises using a virtual reality (VR) exercise system and conventional (Conv) exercises. Ankle movements were recorded with an electrogoniometer. Children and their parents were asked to comment on their interest in the exercise programs. Greater fun and enjoyment were expressed during the VR exercises. Children completed more repetitions of the Conv exercises, but the range of motion and hold time in the stretched position were greater during VR exercises. These data suggest that using VR to elicit or guide exercise may improve exercise compliance and enhance exercise effectiveness.},

@article{bimanual,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hemiplegic cerebral palsy often results in impaired bimanual coordination, partly due to strong coupling between the arms. We aimed at inducing more flexibility in this coupling, to improve bimanual coordination.

METHODS: We designed computer games involving simple perceptual goals, based on Lissajous feedback. Such feedback implicitly facilitates the performance of complex rhythmic bimanual coordination patterns. A sample of six children received 9 h of computer training over a 6 weeks period. The effects of this training on functional bimanual performance were explored using the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA).

RESULTS: Gaming performance and bimanual rhythmic antiphase coordination improved after training. The AHA results were mixed. Two children improved significantly, but at a group level no significant effects were found.

CONCLUSIONS: The results were evaluated in relation to the specificity of the AHA and the potential benefit of combining the proposed training with dedicated bimanual functional training programs.},

@article{review,
abstract = {The use of video games in rehabilitation is becoming more popular to clinicians. These games are embedded in off-the-shelf commercial entertainment applications or especially-developed for clinical purposes. Treatment of cerebral palsy (CP) children is a challenging task for clinicians. Lack of motivation and progress monitoring are two important factors clinicians need to deal with. The use of serious games (SG), sometimes referred to as Virtual Rehabilitation (VR), could therefore be an interesting adjuvant to conventional treatment for these patients. This is however a new discipline and many scientific issues remain to be solved. The aim of this paper is to describe available conventional treatment for CP children together with the level of evidence of each approach. A systematic review of the use of SG in rehabilitation is then conducted. 31 papers (7 randomized clinical trials, 16 cohort studies and 8 single-cases studies) were selected and analyzed, and their level of evidence compared to the conventional treatment. These studies reported outcomes for 352 patients. In summary, this review shows that it is difficult to compare those studies despite the large amount of patients. This is due to the lack of standardization in patient rehabilitation strategy and to the use of various clinical scales and scores. This non-standardization in patient follow-up between previously-published works make evidence-based conclusions difficult to obtain in order to support these techniques objectively. The use of SG for rehabilitation purposes currently meets similar issues. This paper proposes standardization strategies in order to improve treatment comparison and SG use in rehabilitation.},

@article{statistic,
abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate visual function and perception in cerebral palsied (CP) children.

METHODS: A total of 105 congenitally CP children (aged 6-15 years), without severe mental retardation, were classified into three groups: those with spastic quadriplegia, spastic diplegia and spastic hemiplegia. Data collected included patient history, IQ, refraction, far and near visual acuity, position of the eyes and eye movements, visual fields, colour perception, stereoacuity, slit lamp and fundoscopic examinations, and evaluation of visual perception. The results were compared with a control group from the general paediatric population.

RESULTS: The IQ of the CP children ranged between 70 and 100. A total of 59\% of them had best corrected distance visual acuity <6/6, with 25.5\% <6/9. Near visual acuity was also reduced (70.1\% scored <6/6 and 38.4\% scored <6/9). Incidence of refractive errors was higher than in the control group (hypermetropia in 43.8\% of the eyes, myopia 16.19\% and astigmatism 40.9\%) as was the incidence of strabismus (26.7\% esotropic and 27.6\% exotropic). In visual field testing, 80.95\% of CP children were normal. A total of 94.28\% had normal colour perception and 89.52\% were free of ocular pathology. Stereopsis was abnormal or absent in 85.71\% of the cases. Visual perception was markedly reduced: in 57.14\% of the cases it was less than or equal to that of 6-year-old children; in 26.66\% equal to that of 6- to 7.5-year-old children, and in 16.2\% of the cases greater than or equal to that of 7.5-year-old children.

CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of severe mental retardation, CP children have deficient visual skills. It is suggested that the poor visual skills of CP children are a separate, identifiable factor compounding the adverse effects of mental retardation.},
