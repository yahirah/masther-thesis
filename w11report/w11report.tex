\section*{What has been done this week}
During last week I implemented the demo of the game and tested it on few friends, gathering the feedback:
\begin{itemize}
\item background and ground should be 3D structures to allow better depth recognition
\item the scene should have better lights
\item making the controls more advanced may result in more interesting game
\item missiles should be faster
\item using two hands for controlling seems to be interesting idea
\end{itemize}

\section*{Project status according to the study plan}
There is no delay in the plan.

\section*{Plan for the next weeks}
Developing the game.
