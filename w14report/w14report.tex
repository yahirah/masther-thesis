\section*{What has been done this week}
During this week I:
\begin{itemize}
\item implemented levelling system
\item included gesture images into GUI
\item tested the game with children
\end{itemize}

The tests suggest the aiming mechanism may be too difficult and that there may be problem with calibration on children arms. 
\section*{Project status according to the study plan}
There is no delay in the plan.

\section*{Plan for the next weeks}
Implement data gathering part.
